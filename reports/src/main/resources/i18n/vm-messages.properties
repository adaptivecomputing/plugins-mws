# Event messages
vmUtilizationReportPlugin.vm.host.null=The VM ''{0}'' is not reporting the host name, which is likely due to a \
  misconfiguration or misreported value.  The VM's data center can not be determined.
vmUtilizationReportPlugin.vm.name.null=The VM ''{0}'' is not reporting its name, which is likely due to a \
  misconfiguration or misreported value.
vmUtilizationReportPlugin.vm.cpuUtils.null=The VM ''{0}'' is not reporting CPU utilization, which is likely due to a \
  misconfiguration or misreported value.
vmUtilizationReportPlugin.vm.state.null=The VM ''{0}'' is not reporting the vm state, which is likely due to a \
  misconfiguration or misreported value.
vmUtilizationReportPlugin.vm.availableMemory.null=The VM ''{0}'' is not reporting the available memory of the vm, which is likely due to a \
  misconfiguration or misreported value.
vmUtilizationReportPlugin.vm.configuredMemory.null=The VM ''{0}'' is not reporting the configured memory of the vm, which is likely due to a \
  misconfiguration or misreported value.
vmUtilizationReportPlugin.vm.notUpdated=The VM ''{0}'' has not been updated since the last poll, which is likely due to a \
  misconfiguration.
vmUtilizationReportPlugin.total.memory.zero.message=The VM ''{0}'' has a total memory value of 0, which is likely \
  due to a misconfiguration or misreported value.
vmUtilizationReportPlugin.available.equals.total.memory.message=The VM ''{0}'' has available memory value equal \
  to the total memory value.  This is likely due to misconfiguration or misreported values.
vmUtilizationReportPlugin.vm.datacenter.null=The hypervisor {0} is reporting a null data center, which is likely due to a \
  misconfiguration or misreported value.
vmUtilizationReportPlugin.cpu.zero.message=The VM ''{0}'' has a CPU utilization of 0, which is likely due to a \
  misconfiguration or misreported value.

vmUtilizationReportPlugin.webServices.recreateReport.help=Destroys (if it exists) and recreates the vm-utilization \
  report using the current plugin configuration.  WARNING: This web service will destroy any associated samples and \
  datapoints for the vm-utilization report.  Only use this call if the reports parameters must be changed and the \
  historical data does not need to be preserved.
