# Web service messages
nodeUtilizationReportPlugin.recreateReport.success.message=Report ''{0}'' (re)created successfully.  All existing data has \
  been removed.
nodeUtilizationReportPlugin.recreateReport.failure.message=Report ''{0}'' failed to be (re)created.

# Event messages
nodeUtilizationReportPlugin.cpu.zero.message=The node ''{0}'' has a CPU utilization of 0, which is likely due to a \
  misconfiguration or misreported value.
nodeUtilizationReportPlugin.total.memory.zero.message=The node ''{0}'' has a total memory value of 0, which is likely \
  due to a misconfiguration or misreported value.
nodeUtilizationReportPlugin.available.equals.total.memory.message=The node ''{0}'' has available memory value equal \
  to the total memory value.  This is likely due to misconfiguration or misreported values.
nodeUtilizationReportPlugin.node.notUpdated=The node ''{0}'' has not been updated since the last poll, which is likely due to a \
  misconfiguration.
nodeUtilizationReportPlugin.node.reserved=The node ''{0}'' is currently under a maintenance reservation, not including it in the report.
nodeUtilizationReportPlugin.node.state.null=The node ''{0}'' is not reporting the node state, which is likely due to a \
  misconfiguration or misreported value.
nodeUtilizationReportPlugin.node.state.invalid=The node ''{0}'' is reporting a state of ''{1}'', the node utilization report \
  was expecting Idle, Busy, and Running nodes.
nodeUtilizationReportPlugin.node.availableMemory.null=The node ''{0}'' is not reporting the available memory of the node, which is likely due to a \
  misconfiguration or misreported value.
nodeUtilizationReportPlugin.node.realMemory.null=The node ''{0}'' is not reporting the real memory of the node, which is likely due to a \
  misconfiguration or misreported value.
nodeUtilizationReportPlugin.node.name.null=The node ''{0}'' is not reporting its name, which is likely due to a \
  misconfiguration or misreported value.
nodeUtilizationReportPlugin.node.datacenter.null=The node ''{0}'' is reporting a null data center, which is likely due to a \
  misconfiguration or misreported value.
nodeUtilizationReportPlugin.node.cpuUtils.null=The node ''{0}'' is not reporting CPU utilization, which is likely due to a \
  misconfiguration or misreported value.
